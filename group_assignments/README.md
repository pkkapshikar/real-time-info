# Project Proposal

### Introduction of research question
We will be exploring which bus line among the AC Transit 19, 20, and 51A would benefit most from real-time information displays at some of their bus stops. 

### Why this topic matters
Real-time information displays inform transit riders about when the next bus is arriving at their stop. These displays provide convenience for all transit riders, but they are especially useful for those who lack smartphones or access to the Internet and are therefore unable to access bus arrival times by any other means. Real-time information at bus stops provide the most benefit for stops serviced by routes that have more unreliable schedules and infrequent headways as riders at these stops likely have longer or more unpredictable wait times. 

### Spatial scope (and why it matters)
For this project, we will be evaluating the AC Transit 19, 20, and 51A lines, which each run between the cities of Oakland and Alameda, California. We will be using demographic data from census tracts that each of these three bus lines pass through to aid in our analysis of which bus line would benefit most from real-time information displays. 

### Data sources (including links)
We have used AC Transit's bus route GIS shapefile and bus stop GIS data shapefile from AC Transit's Data API & Resource Center. We also used census data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

### Intended analysis and visualizations
For each of the 19, 20, and 51A lines, we analyzed and compared demographic information from the census. We selected demographic characteristics that we believed would reveal which line served populations that were comparatively the most mobility-disadvantaged or had the greatest inaccessibility to technology and, therefore, would likely benefit the greatest from real-time information displays. [To this end], we decided to analyze the following demographic characteristics of each census tract: median rent, [percentage of renters], means of transportation, travel time to work, race/ethnicity, age, and income. 

### Hypotheses
We believe that the [XXX] line would most benefit from real-time information displays at some of their bus stops because...
