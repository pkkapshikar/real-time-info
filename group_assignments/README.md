# Project Proposal

### Introduction of research question
We will be exploring which bus line among the AC Transit 19, 20, and 51A would benefit most from real-time information displays at some of their bus stops. These bus routes run through heavily minority areas of Downton Oakland, Alameda and South Oakland.  

### Why this topic matters
Real-time information displays inform transit riders about when the next bus is arriving at their stop. These displays provide convenience for all transit riders, but they are especially useful for those who lack smartphones or access to the Internet and are therefore unable to access bus arrival times by any other means. Real-time information at bus stops provide the most benefit for stops serviced by routes that have more unreliable schedules and infrequent headways as riders at these stops likely have longer or more unpredictable wait times. 

### Spatial scope (and why it matters)
For this project, we will be evaluating the AC Transit 19, 20, and 51A lines, which each run between the cities of Oakland and Alameda, California. We will be using demographic data from census tracts that each of these three bus lines pass through to aid our analysis of which bus line would benefit most from real-time information displays. Demographic data could point towards certain priority populations without access to smartphones (i.e. seniors) and those who are more heavily reliant on buses to get around (i.e. BIPOC and low-income populations). There is also an equity angle to this project as communities as marginalized commmunities who are more likely to rely on transit will likely benefit from greater convenience and comfort with the presence of real-time information.

### Data sources (including links)
We have used AC Transit's bus route GIS shapefile and bus stop GIS data shapefile from AC Transit's Data API & Resource Center. We also used census data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

### Intended analysis and visualizations
For each of the 19, 20, and 51A lines, we analyzed and compared demographic information from the census. We selected demographic characteristics that we believed would reveal which line served populations that were comparatively the most mobility-disadvantaged or had the greatest inaccessibility to technology and, therefore, would likely benefit the greatest from real-time information displays. We decided to analyze general demographic characteristics (e.g. age, income, and race), transportation characteristics (e.g. percent of workers commuting by car), and housing characteristics (e.g. median rent, number of residents in renter occupied units) of each tract that the lines run through. 

### Hypotheses
We believe that the 51A line would benefit most from real-time information displays at some of their bus stops because it has the longest route out of all of the bus lines considered, potentially making it more likely to face congestion on freeway crossings and therefore be more unreliable. Additionally, the population in the tracts that the 51A runs through are more likely to ride public transit than those in the tracts of the other two lines, making real-time information more beneficial for existing riders as well as potentially attracting more riders from Alameda.
