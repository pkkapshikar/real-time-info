# Project Proposal
We will be exploring which bus line among the AC Transit 19, 20, and 51A would benefit most from real-time information displays at some of their bus stops. 

### Introduction of research question
AC Transit has a few bus lines that run through Alameda, California. Which of the three bus lines (51A, 19, 20) would benefit most from real-time information displayed at stops?

### Why this topic matters
Real-time information displays inform transit riders about when the next bus is arriving at their stop. These displays provide convenience for all transit riders, but they are especially useful for those who lack smartphones or access to the Internet and are therefore unable to access bus arrival times by any other means. Real-time information at bus stops provide the most benefit for stops serviced by routes that have more unreliable schedules and infrequent headways as riders at these stops likely have longer or more unpredictable wait times. 

### Spatial scope (and why it matters)
For this project, we will be evaluating the AC Transit 19, 20, and 51A lines, which each run between the cities of Oakland and Alameda, California. We will only be analyzing demographic data from census tracts that these three bus lines run through. 

### Data sources (including links)
We have used AC Transit's bus route GIS shapefile and bus stop GIS data shapefile from AC Transit's Data API & Resource Center.
