#### Status Update

We have analyzed each bus route according to demographic, housing and transportation dimensions. We have found some patterns associated with these dimensions, which could inform our decision as to where to locate real-time bus arrival information. 

#### Data Update

We have reached out to AC Transit to ask for ridership data per each of the stops for the 3 bus routes we are analyzing. 

#### Concerns
##### Major

We are a small group of only three people. Will we be judged the same way as other groups who have four or five people?

##### Minor
