# Week 3 Status Report

### AC Transit Real-Time Info
#### [Proposal](https://github.com/pkkapshikar/real-time-info/blob/aca0c5003b4e66df2b3c7b70099f8d3f646e2479/group_assignments/README.md)

#### Roles
Purva Kapshikar: 

Creating maps for AC Transit route 51A and analyzing relevant data related to this bus route. Areas of analysis include ridership data, frequency, demographics of areas served (i.e. race and income), housing profiles and transportation choices.

Hamzah Yaacob: 

Creating maps for AC Transit route 19 and analyzing relevant data related to this bus route. Aforesaid areas of analysis. 

Jackson Zeng:

Creating maps for AC Transit route 20 and analyzing relevant data related to this bus route. Aforesaid areas of analysis. 

#### Status Update

We have analyzed each bus route according to demographic, housing and transportation dimensions. We have found some patterns associated with these dimensions, which could inform our decision as to where to locate real-time bus arrival information. During this phase, we have pulled data from the US Census and AC Transit. 

#### Data Update

We have reached out to AC Transit to ask for ridership data per each of the stops for the 3 bus routes we are analyzing. AC Transit has given us data for cumulative ridership on each line, but this data is not very useful for mapping. 

#### Concerns
##### Major

We are a small group of only three people. Will we be judged the same way as other groups who have four or five people?

Not being able to obtain the data that we need from AC Transit. AC Transit may not record data for each individual stop.

##### Minor

NA
