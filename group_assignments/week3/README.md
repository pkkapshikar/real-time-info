# Week 3 Status Report

### AC Transit Real-Time Info
#### [Proposal](https://github.com/pkkapshikar/real-time-info/blob/aca0c5003b4e66df2b3c7b70099f8d3f646e2479/group_assignments/README.md)

#### Roles
Purva Kapshikar: 

Creating maps for AC Transit route 51A and analyzing relevant data related to this bus route.

Hamzah Yaacob: 

Creating maps for AC Transit route 19 and analyzing relevant data related to this bus route.

Jackson Zeng:

Creating maps for AC Transit route 20 and analyzing relevant data related to this bus route.

#### Status Update

We have analyzed each bus route according to demographic, housing and transportation dimensions. We have found some patterns associated with these dimensions, which could inform our decision as to where to locate real-time bus arrival information. To do so, we have pulled data from the US Census and AC Transit. 

#### Data Update

We have reached out to AC Transit to ask for ridership data per each of the stops for the 3 bus routes we are analyzing. AC Transit has given us data for cumulative ridership on each line, but this data is not very useful for mapping. 

#### Concerns
##### Major

We are a small group of only three people. Will we be judged the same way as other groups who have four or five people?

##### Minor
